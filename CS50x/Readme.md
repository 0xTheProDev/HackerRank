 ## Info 

CS50 and HackerRank present the first-ever...

### CS50x CODING CONTEST 2016
an epic weekend of code

Open to CS50x students around the world (and friends). Solve as many problems (in C!) as you can!

### HOW TO PARTICIPATE

  1. Sign up for a (free) HackerRank account at https://www.hackerrank.com/signup.
  2. Register yourself with CS50 for CS50x Coding Contest 2016 at http://cs50.edx.org/register.
  3. Form a team with 0, 1, 2, or 3 classmates (or friends). At least one team member should be taking or should have taken CS50x. Either you or one of your teammates should then create your team at https://www.hackerrank.com/settings/teams, selecting "CS50x Coding Contest 2016" where prompted, and add everyone else to the team. You're welcome to participate in CS50x Coding Contest 2016 alone, but you'll still need to create a team (with just you on it).
  4. Visit https://www.hackerrank.com/cs50x-2016 to sign up for the contest itself, which officially begins on Friday, 29 July 2016, in all time zones! You're welcome to spend as much time on the contest as you'd like, so long as you finish by Sunday, 31 July 2016, in your own time zone. All challenges must be solved in C!

If you'd like to familiarize yourself with HackerRank's interface before CS50x Coding Contest 2016 begins, sign up for some practice challenges at https://www.hackerrank.com/cs50x-2016-practice! No need to create a team to practice.

 ## Prizes 

Prizes will be awarded pseudorandomly to (a few) teams who answer the most questions correctly.
 ## Rules

* Please refrain from discussing strategy during the contest.
* All submissions are run through a plagiarism detector. Any case of code plagiarism will disqualify both users from the contest.
* You can also code using our interface, which currently supports over 40 major languages. Learn about our environment and time limits here. If you are not yet familiar with our platform, check out Solve Me First to acquaint yourself with I/O.
* HackerRank admin decisions are final.

 ## Scoring 

>   Each challenge has a pre-determined score.
    Your score for a problem depends on the number of test cases your submission successfully passes.
    A participant's total score is the sum of the scores earned for each problem attempted. If you submitted more than one solution for a problem, only your highest score achieved will be used in this calculation.
    Participants are ranked by score, with the cumulative time taken (between the contest's start time and the time of your correct submission) used to break ties.
